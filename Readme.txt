Hello Nerd,
	This is the second assignment which I received. 
		* So, I've implemented the CV Parser in my local server now. 
		* I can just go the local host where I've implemented my model and select the pdf which I want to pass, And I'll be getting the output as well in the same screen.
		* I've implemented this by using Flask.
